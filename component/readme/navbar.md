                    '..\repo_food-and-beverage-restautant' to '..\repo-trent-global-college'.   
        (ii)    The work on this Navigation Bar ("NavBar") should last for at least Three (3) 
                calendar days and end after at-most Seven (7) days.
            (ii)(1)     08-08-2021: The setting of the NavBar's structural layout - before implementation of other

            (ii)(5)     15-08-2021: Reduced the use of 'class' items, keyed in new paths to the 'parent' items.
                    The Unordered Lists have one of the following: class="inline-left"; class="inline-right;
                    class="inline-top"; class="inline-bottom".
            (ii)(6)     21-08-2021: A horizontal navbar has been made - with reference "div#navbar-charlie".

                    titled "https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_dropdowns.asp"; as well as the illustrations in 
                    "https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_dropdown_navbar"

                   Cascading Stylesheet - namely the Lists and Attributes - have had their syntax renamed to 
                   include 'div#navbar-charlie' - to create more effective linkage to the 'parent' elements.
